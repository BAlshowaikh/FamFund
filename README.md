# 💰 FamFund

FamFund is a web application that helps families **collaboratively plan, track, and celebrate financial goals** — such as saving for a trip, buying a pet, or purchasing a new TV — while teaching children the value of saving and budgeting.

---

## 🌟 Core Idea
Each family has a shared financial dashboard where:
- **Parents** create and manage family goals.
- **Children** contribute virtual savings and track progress.
- **Everyone** can celebrate milestones and learn from tips.
